# nlp-library
This is a curated list of papers that I have encountered in some capacity and deem worth including in the NLP practitioner's library. Some papers may appear in multiple sub-categories, if they don't fit easily into one of the boxes.

**PRs absolutely welcome!**

Some special designations for certain papers:

:bulb: LEGEND: This is a game-changer in the NLP literature and worth reading.

:vhs: RESOURCE: This paper introduces some dataset/resource and hence may be useful for application purposes.
